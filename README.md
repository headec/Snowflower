# Snowflower (Ongoing)
This is a simple motor control project which involves ELMO, TwinCAT, and MFC.<br>
Each component respectively represents the actual motors(slaves), the main software(master, using ADS socket communication between processes), and the GUI. <br>
This project is *incomplete* and *ongoing*, and will be updated when the author has spare time to work on it.
***
